      **OKD API for Data Protection (OADP)** operator sets up and installs
      Velero on OKD, allowing users to backup and restore
      applications.

      Backup and restore Kubernetes resources and internal images, at the
      granularity of a namespace, using a version of Velero appropriate for
      the installed version of OADP.

      OADP backs up Kubernetes objects and internal images by saving them as
      an archive file on object storage. OADP backs up persistent volumes
      (PVs) by creating snapshots with the native cloud snapshot API or with
      the Container Storage Interface (CSI). For cloud providers that do not
      support snapshots, OADP backs up resources and PV data with Restic or Kopia.
